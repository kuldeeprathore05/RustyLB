# ⚖️ Node.js Load Balancer with Real-Time Dashboard

A custom **Load Balancer** built in Node.js that distributes traffic across multiple backend servers.  
It supports **HTTP (Axios)** and **WebSockets (Socket.IO)** for real-time communication and monitoring.  
Includes a **developer dashboard** to visualize server pool statistics in real-time.

  - **Round Robin** – Distributes requests in sequential order.
  - **Least Connections** – Routes traffic to the server with the fewest active connections.
  - **Weighted Round Robin** – Prioritizes servers with higher weights.
  - **Random** – Chooses a random healthy server.

- **Real-Time Dashboard**
  - View **all servers in the pool** at a glance.
  - Monitor:
    - Active connections per server
    - Average & max response times
    - Server health (healthy / down)
    - Error counts
    - Total requests served
  - Data is updated in **real-time using WebSockets**.

- **Server Health Tracking**
  - Detects failures and marks servers as unhealthy automatically.
